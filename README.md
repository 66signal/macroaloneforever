# Macro Alone Forever

This is simply an effort at porting the [MacroAlone](https://tl.net/forum/brood-war/530524-multitask-macro-training-fighting-spirit) map, which is a Use Maps Settings (UMS) map tool geared at practicing macro and builds unmolested by the AI, to maps other than Fighting Spirit.
In addition, these maps can be used with [Freya's Spirit build order helper tool](https://github.com/FreyasSpirit/freyasspirit.github.io) to include timed messages that help the player with build order timings.

Maps ported so far:
 * Neo Sylphid 2.0
 * Shakuras Temple 1.1
